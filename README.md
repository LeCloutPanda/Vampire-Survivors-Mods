# Vampire Survivor Mods
This is a collection of mods either created by my self or the community, neatly organised into a list.

# Prerequisits

# Warning!!!
Never install/run Dlls that you don't trust.

# Installation 
These instructions are not universal for all mod installations, although they are generally applicable. It is important to note that some mods may require additional libraries or steps, in which case the mod's Github page should be consulted for specific installation instructions.

1) Make sure the game is up to date and you aren't in any special betas for the game.

2) Next, Melon Loader should be downloaded and installed for Vampire Survivors, following the installation guide provided on its Github page. When the game is launched, it may momentarily freeze, indicating that background processes are taking place. Once completed, you should be able to play but it is recommended you close the game and proceed with the steps.

3) Finally, the desired mod/s should be downloaded and placed into the "Mods" folder, after which the game can be launched to enjoy the new features.
