# Installation 
These instructions are not universal for all mod installations, although they are generally applicable. It is important to note that some mods may require additional libraries or steps, in which case the mod's Github page should be consulted for specific installation instructions.

1) To begin, it is necessary to ensure that the latest engine for Vampire Survivors is in use. This can be achieved by accessing the Steam library, right-clicking on the game, selecting properties, and navigating to the beta tab where the code "newenginepls" should be entered.

2) Next, Melon Loader should be downloaded and installed for Vampire Survivors, following the installation guide provided on its Github page. When the game is launched, it may momentarily freeze, indicating that background processes are taking place. Once completed, you should be able to play but it is recommended you close the game and proceed with the steps.

3) Finally, the desired mod/s should be downloaded and placed into the "Mods" folder, after which the game can be launched to enjoy the new features.
